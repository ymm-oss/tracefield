# FSL — AI-Native Formal Specification Language

FSL is a formal specification language for application development, designed with
the primary goal of being **written, verified, and repaired by generative AI**.
The verifier `fslc` uses Lark + Z3 to perform **bounded model checking (BMC)**
and **infinite-depth proofs via k-induction**, and always returns results as
**machine-readable JSON** (for the LLM write→verify→repair loop).
It also includes `fslc scenarios`, which generates integration-test scaffolds from a spec.

Specs can be written in **three layered dialects — consulting (business) / requirements / design (spec)** —
chained via refinement so that requirement IDs propagate transparently across all diagnostics. Non-functional requirements are also supported, down to SLAs (discrete time).
For the language specification, semantics, and output JSON see [`docs/LANGUAGE.md`](docs/LANGUAGE.md);
for a map of all the documentation see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

## First steps

The basic way to use FSL is **not** for a person to memorize the FSL syntax and write it by hand;
instead, you install `fslc` and the Agent Skill and then have an AI agent write the spec,
reading the verification results as it repairs it.

1. **Install FSL and the skill**

   ```bash
   # If you downloaded and unzipped the ZIP from GitHub
   cd ~/Downloads/fsl-main
   bash install.sh

   # If you use the GitHub CLI
   gh repo clone ymm-oss/fsl ~/.fsl
   bash ~/.fsl/install.sh
   ```

   A standard install gives you the verifier `fslc` and the Claude Code skills
   under `~/.claude/skills/`. If you want AI to write FSL in another project too,
   load these skills there.

2. **Ask an AI agent to build it using the requirements skill**

   ```text
   Use $fsl-requirements to write a requirements spec for a cancellation request flow.
   Only approved orders can be canceled; cancellation after shipping is not allowed; refunds must not run twice.
   Verify it, fix any problems, and keep iterating until there are none.
   ```

   For PM use, start with `$fsl-requirements`; for consulting/business-flow work,
   start with `$fsl-business`.
   The AI follows the language reference and repair protocol in the skill,
   creates the `.fsl` file, and verifies it with `fslc`.

   **Note:** what the verifier guarantees is "no contradictions or counterexamples within the scope of what is written in the spec."
   A human should confirm that the spec the AI wrote correctly represents the original business rules, requirements, and exceptional conditions,
   and, when a counterexample appears, that the revised interpretation is reasonable as a matter of business.

3. **If needed, have it generate tests and implementation hookup too**

   Turning acceptance criteria into scenarios, pytest conformance-test scaffolds, and conformance checking
   of existing event logs against the spec can all be chained from the same `.fsl` spec. For this too,
   it is enough to ask the AI: "also build test scaffolds from this spec" or "check whether this log conforms to the spec."

## Easiest of all: just download the executable (no Python needed)

`fslc` is distributed as a **standalone single binary**. You need neither a Python install,
`pip`, nor `git`. Just grab the one file for your OS from GitHub **Releases**
and it runs.

| OS / arch | File to download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon, M1 and later) | `fslc-macos-arm64` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `fslc-linux-x64` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `fslc-linux-arm64` |
| Windows (x64) | `fslc-windows-x64.exe` |

```bash
# Example: macOS (Apple Silicon)
chmod +x fslc-macos-arm64
./fslc-macos-arm64 verify spec.fsl
```

> **macOS note**: a downloaded executable will be blocked by Gatekeeper.
> The first time only, remove the quarantine attribute:
> `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./fslc-macos-arm64`
> (or right-click in Finder → "Open" once).

Each file ships with a companion `*.sha256`. You can verify it with
`shasum -a 256 -c fslc-macos-arm64.sha256`.

> This binary bundles even z3's native library, so all features including `verify`
> work with no external dependencies. If you need skill integration or editable development,
> use the setup instructions below.

## Easy setup (for PMs, consultants, and non-engineers)

No programming knowledge is required. Just these three steps:

1. **Download** — open ymm-oss/fsl on GitHub in your browser and click the green
   **"Code" ▾ → "Download ZIP"** (no login needed, since it is a public repository).
   Double-click the downloaded zip to unzip it.
2. **Open a terminal** (on Mac, "Terminal.app"; search your apps for "terminal").
3. In the folder you unzipped, **run the install command**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/fsl-main      # adjust to the name of the folder you unzipped
   bash install.sh
   ```

This places FSL itself in `~/.fsl`, the `fslc` command in `~/.local/bin/fslc`, and
the Claude Code skills in `~/.claude/skills/`
(once placed, you can delete the folder you downloaded).

> For those who use the GitHub CLI, or engineers: if you have run `gh auth login`, this one line also works:
> `gh repo clone ymm-oss/fsl ~/.fsl && bash ~/.fsl/install.sh`

What gets installed:

- the `fslc` command (used from `~/.local/bin/fslc`)
- the Claude Code skills (`~/.claude/skills/fsl*`)
- samples for PMs and consultants (`examples/pm/`, `examples/consulting/`)

Windows users should use WSL or refer to the developer instructions (PowerShell).

Uninstall:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.fsl ~/.local/bin/fslc ~/.claude/skills/fsl ~/.claude/skills/fsl-business ~/.claude/skills/fsl-requirements ~/.claude/skills/fsl-design ~/.claude/skills/fsl-design-review ~/.claude/skills/fsl-delivery
```

## Developer setup

First get the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymm-oss/fsl && cd fsl
```

There are only two dependencies: `lark` (pure Python) and `z3-solver`
(a prebuilt wheel that bundles the native libz3). **No C++ compiler or separate Z3 install is needed**,
and on Mac / Windows / Linux it is all done with just `pip install` (requires Python 3.9+).

**Mac / Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate         # for fish: source .venv/bin/activate.fish
pip install -e ".[dev]"           # installs lark, z3-solver, pytest and does an editable install of fslc
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # for cmd: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

You can also run it directly without activating the venv:
`./.venv/bin/python -m fslc ...` (on Windows, `.venv\Scripts\python -m fslc ...`).

## Using the CLI directly

```bash
fslc check  specs/cart_v1.fsl                    # syntax/types only (fast loop)
fslc verify specs/cart_v1.fsl --depth 8          # BMC: verified + shortest counterexample/witness
fslc verify specs/cart_v1.fsl --engine induction # k-induction: proved (infinite depth)
fslc scenarios specs/cart_v1.fsl                 # generate integration-test scaffold JSON
fslc replay specs/cart_v1.fsl --trace events.json  # conformance check of an event log
fslc testgen specs/cart_v1.fsl -o test_cart_v1.py  # generate a pytest conformance-test scaffold
fslc refine specs/cart_impl.fsl specs/cart_v1.fsl specs/cart_refines.fsl --depth 8
                                                  # check whether the detailed spec refines the abstract spec
fslc chain fsl-project.toml --keep-going          # run business -> requirements -> design -> impl from a manifest
fslc verify specs/order_system.fsl --depth 8    # compose: synchronized composition of cart + payment

# Validation suite (closes the gap between spec ≠ intent; see docs/DESIGN-{forbidden,vacuity,...})
fslc verify specs/cart_v1.fsl --vacuity error   # detect vacuous properties (unreachable antecedent/trigger, always-true requires)
fslc verify specs/cart_v1.fsl --strict-tags     # match untagged declarations (fabrication candidates) and unreferenced requirements (omission candidates)
fslc mutate specs/cart_v1.fsl                    # spec mutation: measure how much the properties constrain behavior
fslc explain specs/cart_v1.fsl                   # skeleton enumeration + counterfactuals (what would happen without this rule)
fslc typestate specs/order_workflow.fsl --ts    # state machine → applicability check for phantom types + TS scaffold
# (in the requirements dialect, the forbidden block can also write "operation sequences that should be rejected")

# Can also be run as a module without installing
python -m fslc verify specs/cart_v1_buggy.fsl
```

The output is JSON on stdout (`fslc chain` also writes its human status table to
stderr). Exit codes: 0 = verified / proved / refines /
conformant / generated / mutated / explained / typestate; 1 = violated /
refinement_failed / reachable_failed / unknown_cti / nonconformant;
2 = spec error (`error`, including vacuity under `--vacuity error`); 3 = internal error.
`cart_v1_buggy.fsl` returns the shortest counterexample trace for the automatic bounds check (`type_bound`).

## Skills for AI agents

Because FSL is a language not present in training data, when an AI agent (such as Claude Code)
writes a spec, the **Agent Skills** supply the language specification, role-specific
workflow, and repair protocol into context. For easy distribution and discovery,
the canonical copies live under [`skills/`](skills/) at the repository root:

- [`skills/fsl/SKILL.md`](skills/fsl/SKILL.md) — shared verifier workflow / repair protocol / minimal syntax
- [`skills/fsl/reference.md`](skills/fsl/reference.md) — condensed, complete language-reference card
- [`skills/fsl-business/SKILL.md`](skills/fsl-business/SKILL.md) — business process, controls, KPIs, and goals
- [`skills/fsl-requirements/SKILL.md`](skills/fsl-requirements/SKILL.md) — PM requirements, acceptance criteria, forbidden flows, and NFRs
- [`skills/fsl-design/SKILL.md`](skills/fsl-design/SKILL.md) — engineering design specs and refinement to requirements
- [`skills/fsl-design-review/SKILL.md`](skills/fsl-design-review/SKILL.md) — design review, variant checks, and substitutability judgment
- [`skills/fsl-delivery/SKILL.md`](skills/fsl-delivery/SKILL.md) — end-to-end workflow orchestration across planning, requirements, design, and implementation conformance

Claude Code working in this repository recognizes them automatically via `.claude/skills/`
(symbolic links to `skills/*`). To use them in another project,
copy the relevant `skills/fsl*` directories into that project's `.claude/skills/` or into `~/.claude/skills/`,
or point the `gh` skill extension at `skills/` as the distribution source.
See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for details.

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

301 tests (+69 skipped) verify all features (v0-compat / type system / k-induction / leadsTo /
scenarios / runtime / refine / compose / three-layer dialects / NFR) (about 260 seconds).
The two evaluators (Z3 and the concrete Monitor) cross-check each other via differential tests of witness replay, and in addition
a **Z3-independent brute-force oracle** (`tests/oracle.py`) checks for false negatives (misses where something that should be violated/
refinement_failed is wrongly reported as verified/proved/refines).

## Library API

```python
from fslc import parse, build_spec, verify, prove

spec   = build_spec(parse(open("specs/cart_v1.fsl").read()))
result = verify(spec, depth=8)              # BMC. dict (same structure as the CLI)
result = prove(spec, k_ind=1, base_depth=8) # k-induction (proved / unknown_cti)
```
